# Ray Tracer
This is a ray tracer that I wrote in graphics class back in college. I'm proud of it, because it demonstrates inheritance
and polymorphism in addition to graphical calculations, even though the code isn't as clean as I would like.

## Installation
Extract archive to a local directory then run `g++ -lSDL *.cpp -o raytracer` to compile.
Note that you have to have `SDL` installed. A screenshot (`screen_600x600.png`) is included to show what the
generated image should look like with the default input file.

## Usage Notes
This project includes two sample input files (`tester.dat` and `tester2.dat`). 
If the program is executed without arguments, it loads `tester.dat` by default. 
If the program is executed with a filepath as an argument, it will load the file specified.

### Other Notes
It may take a minute for the executable to generate the image after the window is displayed.
