-Compiling instructions
Extract archive to a local directory then run "g++ -lSDL *.cpp -o raytracer" to compile.
Notice that you have to have SDL installed.

- I/O explanation
This file contains 6 planes, 4 spheres, and two lights.
(See the input file). I read in the number of planes, spheres,
and lights, in that order.

Then I read in the planes:
infile >> p.a0 >> p.b0 >> p.c0 >> p.d0;
        
infile >> p.c.r >> p.c.g >> p.c.b; //base color of object
infile >> p.kamb >> p.kdiff >> p.kspec >> p.shininess >> p.reflPerc; //these are all decimal numbers

Then I read in spheres
infile >> s.pc.x >> s.pc.y >> s.pc.z >> s.r;

infile >> s.c.r >> s.c.g >> s.c.b;
infile >> s.kamb >> s.kdiff >> s.kspec >> s.shininess >> s.reflPerc;

Finally I read in lights:
Ambient light first:
infile >> g_tAmbientLight.r >> g_tAmbientLight.g >> g_tAmbientLight.b;
Then the rest:
infile >> g_patLightList[i].p.x >> g_patLightList[i].p.y >> g_patLightList[i].p.z;

infile >> g_patLightList[i].brightness.r >> g_patLightList[i].brightness.g >> g_patLightList[i].brightness.b;

All these inputs are put into a for loop except for the ambient lights and when reading in the number of lights.
See fileio.cpp to see how exactly is is done.
